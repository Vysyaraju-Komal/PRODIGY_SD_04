I‚Äôve developed a Python program that can solve Sudoku puzzles automatically! The program takes an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku and uses the backtracking algorithm to explore all possible solutions, filling in the missing numbers until it finds the correct arrangement. üîç

The project allowed me to dive deep into problem-solving techniques and explore the efficiency of algorithms like backtracking for constraint satisfaction problems. It was a great way to enhance my understanding of recursion, optimization, and algorithm design!

Excited to apply these concepts to more complex challenges in the future!
